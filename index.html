		<h2>Middleschool Flash Games (2009-2013)</h2>
		
		<p>
		These were the first games I ever made.
		Many of them are on kongregate.com under the user name "daflamingpotato".
		Some of them were published on my website, daflamingpotato.webs.com, but that domain has since gone obsolete.
		Luckily I was able to download most of them from the Wayback Machine, so they can live here forever.
		Some of the files I couldn't recover, but some things are better left unseen...
		</p>
		
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>Kongregate Games</h3>
		<p>
		These flash games were released and can surprisingly still be played on the web at 
		<a href="https://www.kongregate.com/accounts/DaFlamingPotato">kongregate.com/accounts/DaFlamingPotato</a>. 
		They use the same flash player emulator (<a href="https://ruffle.rs/">ruffle</a>) 
		that I am using to display the games here on this page. 
		For a while none of the games worked, but since ruffle was released they are playable again! 
		If you remember any favorite flash games from your childhood, chances are you can play them again thanks to ruffle.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I tried to embed these directly into the page, but there seems to be an issue -- maybe Kongregate
		has built-in site locking now so I can't just download them and re-host them here. I'll have to figure it out later.
		For now here are the links to the Kongregate pages. Only downside is there are ads.

		I'm hoping to find a solution, because it was one of the more complete games that I made.</p>

		<p>This game never ends, despite the timer... No, I did not make the score text ginormous, it's just broken now for some reason.</p>

		<p>This was displayed at the top of my website on webs.com; pretty sure I just ripped it from jiggmin's village website.

		<p><b>Platform Game (Site Unlocked)</b></p>
		<p>Beta version of my first platformer game (never released.) I had to decompile the .swf and remove the site blocker code to get it to run.
		Which was apparently super easy to do. So even though I tried to keep people from ripping my games, here I am ripping my own game, years later... Sorry past me.</p>
