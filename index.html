		<h2>Middleschool Flash Games (2009-2013)</h2>
		
		<p>
		These were the first games I ever made.
		Many of them are on kongregate.com under the user name "daflamingpotato".
		Some of them were published on my website, daflamingpotato.webs.com, but that domain has since gone obsolete.
		Luckily I was able to download most of them from the Wayback Machine, so they can live here forever.
		Some of the files I couldn't recover, but some things are better left unseen...
		</p>
		
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>Kongregate Games</h3>
		<p>
		These flash games were released and can surprisingly still be played on the web at 
		<a href="https://www.kongregate.com/accounts/DaFlamingPotato">kongregate.com/accounts/DaFlamingPotato</a>. 
		They use the same flash player emulator (<a href="https://ruffle.rs/">ruffle</a>) 
		that I am using to display the games here on this page. 
		For a while none of the games worked, but since ruffle was released they are playable again! 
		If you remember any favorite flash games from your childhood, chances are you can play them again thanks to ruffle.
		</p>
		
		<p>Click the links below to play the released version on Kongregate. Only downside is there are ads, 
		so I added an embedded version here if you don't want to deal with that.</p>
		<p>You can read (in quotations) the original game descriptions that I wrote at the time as well. Enjoy!</p>

		-- This was the first game that I ever made. Heavily inspired by the Impossible Quiz games. 
		I read a book that I think I borrowed from my friend Bobby about Flash games. Downloaded Macromedia Flash 8 and the rest is history. 
		I still remember that I really enjoyed making this game. 
		There is something magical about making your own thing from scratch--seeing it come alive on screen, and being able to interact with it.</p>

		<p>Fun fact: Right-click was a common trick to get around walls in maze games, which is why it was disabled. 
		However you can still accomplish the same exploit by holding down left click while you move the mouse. 
		The key level is the only one that you can't skip completely,
