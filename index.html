		<h2>Middleschool Flash Games (2009-2013)</h2>
		
		<p>
		These were the first games I ever made.
		Many of them are on kongregate.com under the user name "daflamingpotato".
		Some of them were published on my website, daflamingpotato.webs.com, but that domain has since gone obsolete.
		Luckily I was able to download most of them from the Wayback Machine, so they can live here forever.
		Some of the files I couldn't recover, but some things are better left unseen...
		</p>
		
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3>Kongregate Games</h3>
		<p>
		These flash games were released and can surprisingly still be played on the web at 
		<a href="https://www.kongregate.com/accounts/DaFlamingPotato">kongregate.com/accounts/DaFlamingPotato</a>. 
		They use the same flash player emulator (<a href="https://ruffle.rs/">ruffle</a>) 
		that I am using to display the games here on this page. 
		For a while none of the games worked, but since ruffle was released they are playable again! 
		If you remember any favorite flash games from your childhood, chances are you can play them again thanks to ruffle.
		</p>
		
		<p>Click the links below to play the released version on Kongregate. Only downside is there are ads, 
		so I added an embedded version here if you don't want to deal with that.</p>
		<p>You can read (in quotations) the original game descriptions that I wrote at the time as well. Enjoy!</p>

		-- This was the first game that I ever made. Heavily inspired by the Impossible Quiz games. 
		I read a book that I think I borrowed from my friend Bobby about Flash games. Downloaded Macromedia Flash 8 and the rest is history. 
		I still remember that I really enjoyed making this game. 
		There is something magical about making your own thing from scratch--seeing it come alive on screen, and being able to interact with it.</p>

		Unfortunately Knil's Flash Adventure does not work currently. Something to due with the fact it was made in Stencyl? Not sure.
		I'm hoping to find a solution, because it was one of the more complete games that I made.</p>
		
		<p>I'll leave the link and embed here in case it ever works. 
		I think ruffle still lacks support for actionscript 3, which I believe this uses, so maybe one day it will be playable again.
		Also used the Kongregate API for highscore, which might break things.</p>

		<p>Fun facts: <br>
		Right-click was a common trick to get around walls in maze games, which is why it was disabled. <br>
		However you can still cheat by holding down left click while you move the mouse to go through walls. <br>
		The key level is the only one that you can't skip completely, because you have to activate a cutscene and collect all the keys to beat the level.<p>

		<p><b>Platform Game (Site Unlocked)</b></p>
		<p>Beta version of my first real platformer game, besides Leather Pants. I had to decompile the .swf and remove the site blocker code to get it to run.
		Which was apparently super easy to do. So even though I tried to keep people from ripping my games, here I am ripping my own game, years later... Sorry past me.</p>
		<p>Fun facts: <br>
		It is possible to jump over the wall using the spring. <br>
		Holding down arrow shows a crouching sprite. <br>
		Pressing "S" or "D" just makes the character disappear. Probably some other animation/action that I never finished. Possibly leftover from "Leather Pants". <br>
		The character assets are borrowed from the flash game "Shift". </p>
